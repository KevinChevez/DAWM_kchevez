Rub ghee or vegetable shortening into the flour mixture, with your fingers until it resembles loose bread crumbs.Gradually add water, slowly, and knead to make a soft but firm dough. Roll the dough into a ball, cover with a moist muslin cloth and keep aside.The next step is to make the filling. In a kadai or heavy bottomed pan, warm the ghee, add the jeera and allow it to crackle and tip in the chilli paste. Saute these together for a minute.Add peas followed by all the other spices and cook till the pea mixture becomes dry and all the water has dried up. Season with salt and cook again for 2-3 minutes. Set the peas mixture aside to cool down so it is easier to handle when shaping the samosas.Make a flour paste, by combining the flour and water.To begin making the samosa cases, divide the dough into small balls and roll them into thin circles. Cut each rolled-out circle into two halves by running your knife down the center, so you have 2 semi-circles for each disc. Roll the semi-circles into cones and using a teaspoon fill them with the peas mixture.Dab the flour paste along the edges of the open side of the cone, press the two edges together and seal. Arrange the matar samosas in a platter and cover them with a moist muslin cloth.Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai on medium heat. Deep fry the matar samosas in hot oil till they are golden brown. Try not to fry too many together as it will crowd the kadai and alter the cooking time.Remove the Matar Samosa from the kadai using a slotted spoon and drain them on kitchen paper. Matar Samosa  can be served with a dollop of Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and khajoor imli chutney or tomato ketchup, along with masala chai in the evening.\n",

This makes the crepes soft and fluffy.The next step is to toss the vegetables in a wok.Heat a teaspoon of olive oil in a wok; add the broccoli, onion, bell pepper, sprinkle some salt and toss the vegetables on high heat for just 2 to 3 minutes. Its nice when the vegetables are not over cooked, but are just stir fried to get a crunch in the crepe.Once done, turn off the heat, check the salt and adjust to suit your taste. Stir in the parsley and keep aside.To begin making the crepes, warm a crepe pan with a rim on a medium heat. Butter or oil it evenly. When the pan gets hot, pour just enough batter to cover the base, and start tilting and swirling the pan to spread the batter and make a crepe.  These crepes gets cooked really quick and you need to cook it just until the bottom begins to get a little golden, then gently lift the edges and flip the crepe to cook on the other side for a few seconds.Transfer the prepared whole wheat crepes to a platter and cover with a dome lid to keep warm and soft.

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Pita bread we will first have to get your ingredients ready especially the yeast. If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet.If you are using fast action yeast (looks more like fine semolina) then in a large bowl combine the flours, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky. Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes. Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours.After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled. At this point punch the dough down and knead gently. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C. The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them. Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread. Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well. Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle. Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick. Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven. Bake the pita dough until they puff - you will see them rising forming bubbles, to slowly puffing and fully puffing up.The whole process takes a maximum or 3-5 minutes and not more than 5 minutes. If the pita bread does not rise in 5 minutes, then take them out. The Pita Bread will still be cooked, but just wont have pockets and will still taste just as good.You can serve Whole Wheat Pita Bread Recipe along with soups or make it into sandwiches like Egg Bhurji Stuffed Pita Pockets Recipe, Aloo Tikki Stuffed Pita Sandwich Recipe, Pita Sandwich With Cauliflower Falafel And Roasted Vegetables Recipe and more.\n",

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Ulundu Kozhukattai Recipe - Uppu Kozhukattai/ Urad Dal Modak, first soak the urad dal in 2 cups of water for about 3 to 4 hours. Drain the water completely. Combine the dal, green chillies, ginger, salt and asafoetida powder and blend into a coarse batter.Place the batter in steamer plates or idli plates and steam on high heat for about 10 minutes until cooked. To check if it is cooked insert a knife in the center and it should come out clean.Remove from the steamer and allow it to cool. Once partially cool, cut into pieces crumble the steamed lentils until there are no lumps.Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan; add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle. Stir in the crumbled steamed lentils into the seasoning and saute for a few minutes until well combined.Allow the urad dal/ ulundu to cool. Once cool divide the lentils into 10-15 oval shaped portions and keep aside. This will be the savory filling for the rice wrapperTo make the wrapper for the modak/ Ulundu KozhukattaiBring the water to a boil in a pan along with the salt and oil.Gradually add little rice flour at time and keep stirring till the Ulundu Kozhukattai mixture comes together.Turn off the heat and transfer the rice flour mixture to another bowl and cover with a muslin cloth. Keep it aside for 5 minutes. It will help the Ulundu Kozhukattai dough to come together.With a little oil in a cup, smear the oil in your hands and knead the dough well to remove any lumps. At all times make sure keep the dough covered with a wet muslin cloth to prevent the dough from drying out.Take a lemon size portion of the Ulundu Kozhukattai dough, make into a ball and press the dough in the palm of your hands to make a flat dough, cup your palms a bit so it forms a depression in the center.Place the urad dal filling in the center and bring the edges of the dough together to the center to make an oval shape Ulundu KozhukattaiContinue the similar process with the remaining portions of the dough and dal fillingNote: Keep dipping and smearing your fingers and palms with sesame oil when you handle a new portion of the dough.

   "TranslatedInstructions": "To begin making the Ulundu Kozhukattai Recipe - Uppu Kozhukattai/ Urad Dal Modak, first soak the urad dal in 2 cups of water for about 3 to 4 hours. Drain the water completely. Combine the dal, green chillies, ginger, salt and asafoetida powder and blend into a coarse batter.Place the batter in steamer plates or idli plates and steam on high heat for about 10 minutes until cooked. To check if it is cooked insert a knife in the center and it should come out clean.Remove from the steamer and allow it to cool. Once partially cool, cut into pieces crumble the steamed lentils until there are no lumps.Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan; add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle. Stir in the crumbled steamed lentils into the seasoning and saute for a few minutes until well combined.Allow the urad dal/ ulundu to cool. Once cool divide the lentils into 10-15 oval shaped portions and keep aside. This will be the savory filling for the rice wrapperTo make the wrapper for the modak/ Ulundu KozhukattaiBring the water to a boil in a pan along with the salt and oil.Gradually add little rice flour at time and keep stirring till the Ulundu Kozhukattai mixture comes together.Turn off the heat and transfer the rice flour mixture to another bowl and cover with a muslin cloth. Keep it aside for 5 minutes. It will help the Ulundu Kozhukattai dough to come together.With a little oil in a cup, smear the oil in your hands and knead the dough well to remove any lumps. At all times make sure keep the dough covered with a wet muslin cloth to prevent the dough from drying out.Take a lemon size portion of the Ulundu Kozhukattai dough, make into a ball and press the dough in the palm of your hands to make a flat dough, cup your palms a bit so it forms a depression in the center.Place the urad dal filling in the center and bring the edges of the dough together to the center to make an oval shape Ulundu KozhukattaiContinue the similar process with the remaining portions of the dough and dal fillingNote: Keep dipping and smearing your fingers and palms with sesame oil when you handle a new portion of the dough. This will prevent the Ulundu Kozhukattai from sticking to your handsPrepare the steamer filled with water. Place the Ulundu Kozhukattai in the steamer plate and into the steamer.Steam for about 10 minutes until the Ulundu Kozhukattai look shiny and smooth.

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Mukhadi Halwa recipe, remove 3 table spoons of semolina from one cup of semolina. and replace it with 3 tablespoons of all purpose flour. Transfer this mix into a bowl and add milk. Whisk them together and set aside while you begin to prep for caramelising the sugar.Heat a heavy bottomed pan, add ghee and once it begins to get hot (not smoking), reduce the heat to medium. Add sugar and level it in ghee using a spatula. After five minutes stir the sugar using a spatula (using spatula helps ensure that the caramel won’t stick to it). Keep stirring once in a while till the sugar starts caramelizing as it melts. (The colour of the caramel should not deepen or darken in colour as this will lead to a bitter tasting halwa)Give a quick stir to the flour-semolina batter and slowly add it to the caramelised sugar.Now, starts the tricky part. Hold the wok or pan firmly using a cloth or holder (to avoid the heat) so that you can work your way with the batter. Using ladle (a large heavy spoon/ kalchhul), carefully yet swiftly start mixing the batter into the caramel. The batter will seem to turn lumpy but nothing to worry.Increase the flame to medium and using the back of the spoon keep smashing the batter, especially the whitish lumps, till the whole batter gets completed assimilated and incorporated with the caramel and the halwa wears a homogeneous look.This process will take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. You will also notice that the halwa releases the oil as it begins to come together as evenly toned mixture. At this point, remove excess oil in a small bowl and again roast the halwa for 3 to 4 minutes. Switch off the heat and push the halwa towards the edge of one side of the wok to allow any excess ghee to drain in the centre. Once the ghee leaves the halwa, drain it out in the bowl. Halwa is now ready to be served!Serve Mukhadi Halwa as a dessert after your weekday meal of Dal Makhani, Aloo Ki Sabzi and Phulka.\n",

The batter will seem to turn lumpy but nothing to worry.Increase the flame to medium and using the back of the spoon keep smashing the batter, especially the whitish lumps, till the whole batter gets completed assimilated and incorporated with the caramel and the halwa wears a homogeneous look.This process will take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. You will also notice that the halwa releases the oil as it begins to come together as evenly toned mixture. At this point, remove excess oil in a small bowl and again roast the halwa for 3 to 4 minutes. Switch off the heat and push the halwa towards the edge of one side of the wok to allow any excess ghee to drain in the centre. Once the ghee leaves the halwa, drain it out in the bowl. Halwa is now ready to be served!Serve Mukhadi Halwa as a dessert after your weekday meal of Dal Makhani, Aloo Ki Sabzi and Phulka.",

   "Instructions": "To begin making Stuffed Arbi Paratha Recipe, we will make the paratha dough. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt.Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour. Add little water at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough. Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead little more. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky. Divide the dough into 8 to 10 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you get the filling ready.Pressure cook arbi with 1 cup water and salt for around 4 whistle and switch off the heat.Once it is pressure cooked, allow the pressure to release naturally and peel the skin.Mash the arbi into a coarse lumpy texture with your fingers or a fork. Once mashed, add in the finely chopped green chillies, lots of freshly chopped coriander leaves,  salt to taste, half teaspoon of cumin powder, half a teaspoon of coriander powder, a teaspoon of dry mango powder, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder and finally if you want it extra spicy, the red chilli powder. Using your fingers again, mix all the ingredients into the arbi until well combined.Divide the arbi filling into 8 to 10 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of arbi paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.The final step is to stuff the filling into the arbi paratha dough.We dust the paratha dough in flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter circle.Take a portion of filling and place it in the center. Next Gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together. Remove the little excess dough which popped out when you brought them together. Press the filled arbi paratha dough down.Dust the filled arbi paratha dough in some flour and roll it gently applying just a pressure. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of paratha dough and filling.Preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled arbi paratha. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around. Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the arbi parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the arbi paratha is cooked transfer to a plate.

Keep this kaju badam paste aside.The next step is to make a sugar syrup for the ladoos. Bring sugar and water to boil and wait until the sugar syrup reaches 1 string consistency. It is very important to get the sugar syrup to 1 string consistency if you miss this step, the burfi/balls will be not set and harden.Once you have a one string consistency of the sugar syrup, add the cashew almond paste and the cardamon powder.

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Mushroom Dumpling Recipe, we will first make the dough. To make the dumpling (momo) dough;  add the flour into a large mixing bowl, add a little water at a time to the flour and knead well to make a smooth and yet firm dough. We don't add the salt or oil to make the dumpling dough. Cover the dough and allow it to rest for about 20 minutes, till we get the filling ready.Next step is the make the filling for the dumplings. Heat the oil in a saucepan on medium heat.  Add the mushrooms, sprinkle some salt and stir fry on high heat until the mushroom become tender. Mushrooms release a lot of water, so stir-fry until all the moisture evaporates.Once the mushrooms are cooked and dry, allow it to cool. Once the mushrooms cool down, add it to a large bowl and combine it with the remaining filling ingredients including the oil. Our final step is to make the Mushroom DumplingsDivide the dough into small lemon sized portions of an inch in diameter. Dust the dough portions in flour and roll out into a circle. Don’t roll too thick, as the filling will push itself out and tear when steamed.Place a small spoon of filling in the center of the rolled circle. Bring together the edges of the dough with a pinching and folding motion on one side and bring the other side to hold to the pinched side. By doing this, the half moon shaped momos (dumplings) will have a frilled look. Proceed the similar way with the remaining dough.As you keep shaping the dumplings (momos) you need to keep them on a greased platter and cover with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out.While you are shaping the dumplings (momos), keep a steamer with water boiling. Grease the steamer pan with some oil to prevent the momos from sticking.Place the shaped dumplings (momos) on the greased steamer pan. So when you have one set of shaped dumplings, place them in the steamer and steam on high for 5 to 7 minutes until you see a glaze on the skin. Serve the Mushroom Dumplings along with a hot and spicy Homemade Red Chilli Garlic Sauce Recipe as a tea time snack or as an appetizer for parties with Chinese Vegetable Dry Manchurian Balls Recipe.\n",

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Dahi Bhindi Recipe, we will first roast the Bhindi .Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a Wok or a Kadai; add the chopped onions and the bhindi (okra). Sprinkle some salt and sauté the bhindi and the onions on low heat. Keep the pan covered for the few minutes so the bhindi gets cooked.When covered the bhindi releases moisture, but this moisture helps it to cook and soften as well.Once you notice that it has released a little moisture and the bhindi is slightly softened, open the pan and stir fry the bhindi until it is well roasted. Make sure you roast it on medium heat. Roast the Bhindi until you notice it has begun to shrink and has browned. It should not become sticky, slimy and gooey. If it has turned this way, add a little more oil and sprinkle some gram flour/besan and stir it gently. This will absorb the sliminess.The bhindi is a tricky vegetable to cook, so it takes some practice to not making it gooey.Once the bhindi is cooked and well roasted, keep it aside till we prepare the yogurt gravy.To make the Yogurt Curry, add the yogurt into a saucepan; add the gram flour, grated ginger, garam masala powder,  turmeric powder and chili powder. Whisk until smooth. Add in 1/4 cup of water and whisk again until well combined.Place the saucepan on a medium heat and allow the yogurt mixture to come to a brisk boil. Allow it to boil for a couple of minutes and then turn the heat to low. Simmer the mixture until the yogurt becomes thick and creamy. Once thick and creamy, add in the roasted bhindi and stir. Simmer for a few more minutes. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.Turn off the heat and transfer the Dahi Bhindi a serving bowl. The final step is to make the seasoning. Heat a tablespoon of ghee in a Tadka Pan. Add the cumin seeds, dry red chilies and roast them until lightly browned.Pour this seasoning and the caramelized onions into the Dahi Bhindi. Stir to mix gently and finally stir in the chopped coriander leaves.Serve the Dahi Bhindi along with Phulka Recipe  or Steamed Rice and  Green Moong Sprout Salad for a simple weeknight dinner or even a weekend lunch.\n",

This will absorb the sliminess.The bhindi is a tricky vegetable to cook, so it takes some practice to not making it gooey.Once the bhindi is cooked and well roasted, keep it aside till we prepare the yogurt gravy.To make the Yogurt Curry, add the yogurt into a saucepan; add the gram flour, grated ginger, garam masala powder,  turmeric powder and chili powder. Whisk until smooth. Add in 1/4 cup of water and whisk again until well combined.Place the saucepan on a medium heat and allow the yogurt mixture to come to a brisk boil. Allow it to boil for a couple of minutes and then turn the heat to low. Simmer the mixture until the yogurt becomes thick and creamy. Once thick and creamy, add in the roasted bhindi and stir. Simmer for a few more minutes. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.Turn off the heat and transfer the Dahi Bhindi a serving bowl. The final step is to make the seasoning. Heat a tablespoon of ghee in a Tadka Pan. Add the cumin seeds, dry red chilies and roast them until lightly browned.Pour this seasoning and the caramelized onions into the Dahi Bhindi. Stir to mix gently and finally stir in the chopped coriander leaves.Serve the Dahi Bhindi along with Phulka Recipe  or Steamed Rice and  Green Moong Sprout Salad for a simple weeknight dinner or even a weekend lunch.",

This step must be done quickly to avoid lumps.

Moist and freshly washed hands are required since the dough is sticky.Knead for about 5-7 minutes to get rid of lumps if any and to smoothen the pre-cooked flour.Roll the mixture into a cylinder and divide them equally. This should give you about 4 equal sized balls.Keep them covered at all times. Knead each ball for 15-20 seconds and roll it out just like regular ujju rotis using rice flour to dust.

Cool it completely and then add it to a blender and blend it to a fine puree. Set it aside for later use.Proceed to make the flourless cake, next. To do that, first set the oven to pre heat at 170 degrees C.

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Corn Matar Kachori Recipe, we will first make the dough for the outer crust of the Matar Kachori.In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients for the Kachori dough to form a crumble like texture. Gradually add water into the flour mixture and knead to make a soft and smooth dough.Once all the flour has come together, keep kneading for 3 to 4 minutes so the dough becomes smooth and soft. Cover the dough and keep it aside for 10 minutes till we prepare the filling for the kachori.The next step is to make the filling for the Corn and Matar Kachori.Into a food processor, add all the filling ingredients and pulse to make a coarse mixture. Once the kachori filling is ready, transfer to a bowl, check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.The next step is the roll out the dough and make the Matar Kachoris. You can either shape them as flat breads or keep it as a ball, its a personal choice.And to cook the Kachori's you can either use an Air Fryer, Bake in an Oven or Deep Fry them. I have tried all the methods and my favorite has been with the Air Fryer. The best part about using the Air Fryer is, I was able to pre-make these Kachoris in the Air Fryer and reheat it in the Air Fryer to make it crisp again.Divide the dough into 12 to 15 equal portions and roll out each dough into 2 inch diameter circles.Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of the rolled out dough. Bring all the sides of the dough together to seal the filling. Twist the dough to seal the Corn Matar Kachori well. When you bring the dough you might find some excess dough collected on the top, remove this dough.Proceed to make the remaining Matar Kachoris the similar way.You can either choose to keep the Kachori like a ball or roll the Kachori gently to make a 3 inch diameter circle. Take care when you roll, as the filling might spill out.If you are using the Air Fryer or the Oven, then preheat them at 180 C for about 15 minutes. Place the Kachoris in the Air Fryer Basket or the Baking sheet (for the oven) and bake until the Kachoris are golden brown and crisp on all sides.If you plan to deep fry them, then preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is heated, fry the Kachoris on low to medium heat until you get a deep golden brown color and it is crisp. Once golden, drain on absorbent paper and proceed to make the remaining Kachoris the similar way.Serve these mouth watering Corn and Matar Kachoris as a tea time or evening snack along with Green Chutney and Date Chutney. You can also serve them as starter for dinner parties.\n",

   "Instructions": "We begin making the Chocolate Tart Recipe by following the below procedures:Method for making the tart crustIn a large mixing bowl; combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the butter and mix the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add in a tablespoon of ice water at a time and knead to bring the flour together.Knead to form a firm dough that is firm and does not break apart when you try to press it. Make sure you only add a tablespoon of water at a time, as the warmth of your hand will help bring the flour together to form a dough. Wrap the pastry crust dough in cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out to make a circle of 12 inch diameter that is about 1/4 inch thick. Lift the dough carefully from the floured surface and place it in a 9 inch tart pan with a removable base.Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan. It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the pan's ring. Remove the excess dough that is hanging off the sides of the pan. Place the tart crust in the freezer for atleast another 15 minutes. This process of chilling the crust, helps make the crust flaky when baked.Prebaking the Tart CrustPreheat the oven to 180 C. Once the oven is preheated, Prick the chilled tart crust with a fork, so it does not puff up while in the oven. Cover the tart crust with foil, place pie weights or beans on the crust and prebake the crust for about 25 minutes. The tart will look golden brown but not completely baked. Remove the tart crust from the oven and allow the oven to be on at 180C.Remove the foil and pie weights/ beans and keep the crust aside while we prepare the filling.Method for Chocolate FillingWhisk the eggs in a bowl until light and flully. Keep aside.To make the chocolate filling for the tart, place the heavy cream and milk in a sauce pan over medium heat, add in the chopped chocolate and keep stirring on low heat till you see the chocolate melting half way through. Turn off the heat and proceed to melt the chocolate into the milk and cream mixture in the existing heat. Add in the sugar and salt and whisk the chocolate cream mixture until well combined.Next add in the whisked eggs into the chocolate cream mixture and whisk it in well until well combined. The chocolate cream filling mixture is now ready to be poured into the tart crust.Pour the filling into the tart crust and place it back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away as this indicates that the tart is getting overbaked.Keep monitoring the Chocolate Tart while its in the oven, as the baking times differ from oven to oven. It is important to monitor so you don't over bake the chocolate.Remove the Chocolate Tart from the oven, and allow it to cool completely. Refrigerate the Chocolate Tart for about 8 hours until set and serve it along with fresh fruits, like strawberries.Serve the Chocolate Tart Recipe as a Dessert for a Get together Party to amuse your guest.\n",

Place the tart crust in the freezer for atleast another 15 minutes. This process of chilling the crust, helps make the crust flaky when baked.Prebaking the Tart CrustPreheat the oven to 180 C. Once the oven is preheated, Prick the chilled tart crust with a fork, so it does not puff up while in the oven. Cover the tart crust with foil, place pie weights or beans on the crust and prebake the crust for about 25 minutes. The tart will look golden brown but not completely baked. Remove the tart crust from the oven and allow the oven to be on at 180C.Remove the foil and pie weights/ beans and keep the crust aside while we prepare the filling.Method for Chocolate FillingWhisk the eggs in a bowl until light and flully. Keep aside.To make the chocolate filling for the tart, place the heavy cream and milk in a sauce pan over medium heat, add in the chopped chocolate and keep stirring on low heat till you see the chocolate melting half way through. Turn off the heat and proceed to melt the chocolate into the milk and cream mixture in the existing heat. Add in the sugar and salt and whisk the chocolate cream mixture until well combined.Next add in the whisked eggs into the chocolate cream mixture and whisk it in well until well combined. The chocolate cream filling mixture is now ready to be poured into the tart crust.Pour the filling into the tart crust and place it back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away as this indicates that the tart is getting overbaked.Keep monitoring the Chocolate Tart while its in the oven, as the baking times differ from oven to oven. It is important to monitor so you don't over bake the chocolate.Remove the Chocolate Tart from the oven, and allow it to cool completely. Refrigerate the Chocolate Tart for about 8 hours until set and serve it along with fresh fruits, like strawberries.Serve the Chocolate Tart Recipe as a Dessert for a Get together Party to amuse your guest.",

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Pista Burfi Recipe, soak the pistachios in warm water for about half an hour. Once soaked, drain the water and blend the pistachios along with the coconut in the blender until you can a almost smooth burfi mixture. Keep the mixture aside.The next step is to make the syrup for the burfi. In a medium size sauce pan; stir in the sugar and 1/4 cup water with heat on medium. Once the sugar has melted continue to boil the sugar mixture until the liquid reaches a two string consistency.To know the right consistency - do the cold water candy test. Take few tablespoons of water in a cup; add a drop of sugar syrup to water. If it holds its shape like a softball and doesn’t dissolve into water then it’s at the right consistency.Once the sugar syrup has reached the right consistency, add the ground pista and coconut mixture, the cardamom powder to the sugar syrup.With the heat on medium continue stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pan.In 10 to 15 minutes, the pista burfi mixture will thicken and will come away from the sides of the pan. This happens with the coconut and pista releasing its oil.At this stage turn off the heat and be careful not to stir any longer on heat as the mixture can get over cooked and will not set to the consistency required. The sugar will crystallize making the burfi very hard.Transfer the mixture on a greased square pan and spread it evenly on the top and press it down so its sets well. Allow the pista burfi to cool completely.Once cooled, cut the Pista Burfi into squares and serve.You can make the Pista Burfi as a dessert when you have guests at home or make for festivals like Holi, Diwali and Raksha Bandhan.You can also serve it after your delicious meal of Dal Makhani, Aloo Bhindi Sabzi, Palak Raita, Phulka and Jeera Rice.\n",

Also add fish sauce, if you are a vegetarian or don't like the smell of fish sauce you can replace it with soya sauce. Also add brown sugar or palm sugar to the lemon sauce and mix everything together. You can add dried shrimps at this stage for an authentic flavour but if you are a vegetarian you can give it a pass.Place the chopped beans in the mortar and bruise them slightly with the pestle so that the juices can run out and it can absorb the dressing better. Take tomato and scoop out its pulp using a spoon. Cut the tomato into juliennes or into cubes, as you like.Add the papaya juliennes to the dressing bowl along with beans and tomato. Toss everything together and transfer it to a serving bowl.Toss on top toasted salted peanuts. If you like you can crush the peanuts I just used them halved.

For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring it to boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously. This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it the milk is reduced to more than half of its quantity, stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Finally stir in the Thandai Paste Mix and give the mixture a good stir. You can even use a hand blender to give it a good whisk.Turn off the heat and allow the kulfi mixture to cool completely. Pour the thandai kulfi milk in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator. The Thandai Kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.Once the Thandai Kulfi is frozen you can run the kulfi moulds under water to enable easy release on to the plate.Serve Thandai Kulfi Recipe as a Indian dessert for parties or even make it as a special dessert for the festival of holi.\n",

Combine all the roasted ingredients with the rest of the remaining ingredients and blend into a fine powder.Store the Muri/Moodi Masala in the freezer to retain freshness for about 4 to 6 months. We will not be using all the masala for this dish.To next step is to make the Ghugni Recipe. We will first cook the soaked yellow peas until soft and mushy. See video recipe of how to cook peas in a pressure cooker. Soak for 4 hours or overnight & cook in the pressure cooker along with 2 cups of water and a pinch of salt for about 3 whistles. After 3 whistles turn the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes and turn off the heat. Allow the pressure to release naturally.Peas comes under the legume category when dried and hence requires the similar amount of soaking and cooking time as other legumes. Once the yellow peas are cooked, making the Ghugni is very simple.Heat a teaspoon of oil in a pan; add in the grated ginger, turmeric powder, the cooked peas and just 1 or 2 teaspoons of the above moodi masala. Adjust the salt as required. Give the Ghugni a quick boil, then stir in the chopped coriander leaves and turn off the heat.Serve the Calcutta Ghugni along with thinly sliced ginger and more green chillies on the top as a tea time snack or even along with Gujarati Methi Thepla for dinner.\n",

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Mixed Millet Phulka Recipe first bring all the ingredients together and we will make the dough.In a large bowl combine the ragi, jowar, bajra, wheat flour and salt; add a little water at a time to make firm dough. Add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead for a few more minutes until smooth.Set the millet phulka dough aside to rest covered for 15 minutes. Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions.Preheat the iron skillet on medium high heat. Roll the portions of phulka (roti) dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.Take a portion of the Millet phulka dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Cook the millet phulka as indicated in the steps below. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.*Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Gas StovePlace rolled dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled dough to the other side on the skillet.After a few seconds turn the flame to high; using tongs take the rolled Millet phulka off the skillet and place it directly on the flame. It should balloon into a spherical shape and puff up.Remove the Millet phulka from heat, place it on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled Millet phulka dough and keep stacking them one over the other.*Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Electric StoveThis process can be used if you are using a gas stove as well.Preheat an iron skillet. Place rolled Millet phulka dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled Millet phulka dough to the other side on the skillet.Flip over again and cook the first side pressing lightly with a napkin. The rolled out phulka dough should begin to start puffing out.Flip and cook the other side for a few more seconds.Remove from the heat, place the Millet phulka on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up. Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled dough and keep stacking them the phulka one over the other.Serve the Mixed Millet Phulka Recipe with Spinach Paneer Kofta Curry and Dangar Pachadi With Grated Carrots to create complete healthy meal.TipMaking the rolled out phulka dough puff into a balloon comes with practice. So give yourself time if you are new to bread making.Even if yours does not puff the first time or the times after, the rotis that you have made are cooked and are edible, so you could consume them with your choice of vegetables.Using thinner rolling pins is the key, as you want to be gentle with the dough.The heavy big ones will make you press harder which might just make it tear. It’s well worth investing in a thinner rolling pin and tongs to hold the bread which is available in most Indian stores around the world.Tossing the phulka dough in flour as you roll is another helper that will make the rolling out the dough easier.\n",

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Khatti Meethi Tindora Recipe, we will first steam the vegetable in a steamer or a pressure cooker.  If you are using a pressure cooker, cut the tinda into the desired shape, either into rounds or into think slices. Place the cut vegetable into the pressure cooker, sprinkle some salt and 2 tablespoons of water.Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and cook the tinda until you hear two whistles. After two whistles, turn off the heat.We will now release the pressure immediately, by running the pressure cooker under cold water. By doing this, we are making sure we don't over cook the vegetable and at the same time retain the nutrition content.Open the pressure cooker once the pressure is released and keep it aside.Our next step is to season the vegetable with spices. Heat the oil in a large wok or a heavy bottomed pan. Once the oil is heated; add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Allow them to crackle. Next add in the curry leaves, the steamed vegetable and the remaining ingredients except the roasted peanuts and the chopped coriander.Sauté the tindora sabzi until all the spices get well coated and combined onto the vegetable.The tindora sabzi will have a soft and juicy texture to it. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste. Turn off the heat once you achieve this consistency (about 3 to 4 minutes of stir frying).Finally stir in the peanuts and the chopped coriander leaves. Transfer the Tindora nu shaak to a serving bowl.Serve Khatti Meethi Tindora Sabzi Recipe along with Gujarati Kadhi, Methi Thepla and Steamed Rice for a weekday dinner.\n",

It takes 30 minutes at medium flame.Meanwhile, separate the egg yolk from the eggs and keep aside.Once the milk reduces to half, add all the chopped dry fruits like Almonds, Pistachios and Cashew nuts. Do not add Raisins at this point since it may sour the milk causing it to curdle.Add sugar and keep stirring till the sugar get completely dissolved. This may cause a thinning effect on milk. Hence, keep stirring and let the mixture boil again until reduced to a creamy consistency.Once we add sugar the milk may get thin again, so keep stirring and boil the milk till it acquires a thick and creamy consistency.Take the egg whites in a separate bowl beat it till frothy.With the help of a spoon gradually add beaten egg white into the boiling milk in low flame, stirring.Beat the remaining egg white again to make froth. Again with a spoon take the frothing egg white and add in the milk, stirring. Repeat the process till all the egg white is spooned into the saucepan. The egg white froth appears like little dumplings in milk. Keep stirring.Keep the flame low and let the dumplings cook well. Allow the milk to cook till it becomes golden in color and gets a creamy texture.Now add Kewda water into it. This gives a royal aroma to kheer and eliminates the smell of eggs.Now add in raisins and put off the flame.Allow Andey Ki Kheer (Egg White Kheer) Recipe to cool down to room temperature.Refrigerate it for a couple of hours to adore the chilled Andey Ki Kheer or enjoy it warm. Serve Andey Ki Kheer as a dessert after your delicious meal of Palak Dal, Sev Tamatar Ki Sabzi and Tawa Paratha.\n",

Do not add Raisins at this point since it may sour the milk causing it to curdle.Add sugar and keep stirring till the sugar get completely dissolved. This may cause a thinning effect on milk. Hence, keep stirring and let the mixture boil again until reduced to a creamy consistency.Once we add sugar the milk may get thin again, so keep stirring and boil the milk till it acquires a thick and creamy consistency.Take the egg whites in a separate bowl beat it till frothy.With the help of a spoon gradually add beaten egg white into the boiling milk in low flame, stirring.Beat the remaining egg white again to make froth. Again with a spoon take the frothing egg white and add in the milk, stirring. Repeat the process till all the egg white is spooned into the saucepan. The egg white froth appears like little dumplings in milk. Keep stirring.Keep the flame low and let the dumplings cook well. Allow the milk to cook till it becomes golden in color and gets a creamy texture.Now add Kewda water into it. This gives a royal aroma to kheer and eliminates the smell of eggs.Now add in raisins and put off the flame.Allow Andey Ki Kheer (Egg White Kheer) Recipe to cool down to room temperature.Refrigerate it for a couple of hours to adore the chilled Andey Ki Kheer or enjoy it warm. Serve Andey Ki Kheer as a dessert after your delicious meal of Palak Dal, Sev Tamatar Ki Sabzi and Tawa Paratha.",

Cover the pan and steam cook the pakora's until you notice the top has steamed.Once the top has steamed, flip them over to cook on the other side. Continue to cook on medium heat until the pakoras has cooked through from the inside and have a golden brown color. Proceed the same way with the remaining pakora batter and keep them aside.*Method for the Punjabi KadhiWhisk the yogurt, gram flour, water, asafoetida, chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder and salt until well blended. Add the water and whisk more until well blended. Place the kadhi in a saucepan, on medium high heat and allow it to come to a brisk boil.Keep whisking it continuously while it is on heat, as this will help the yogurt and the spices along with gram flour come together into a creamy texture. Allow the kadhi to boil briskly for about 3 to 4 minutes, then turn the heat to low and simmer for another 5 minutes.The simmering process helps the kadhi get the flavors of the spices and the gram flour. It will thicken slightly and attain a smooth creamy consistency and it will have a shine to it.Towards the end of the simmering process, add in the spinach pakora's. We will proceed to make the seasoning for the Khadi.Heat ghee in a large sauce pan; add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, cinnamon stick and the whole red chillies. Allow them to crackle. Add the onions and ginger and saute until onions turn golden and tender.

Traditionally, the dals are soaked for 24 hours, changing water every 8 hours.When you are ready to prepare the dal, after sufficient soaking time, take a heavy bottom pan (or a slow cooker) and bring 5 cups of water with a dash of salt, to boil in it.Add the pre soaked dal and rajma to it and let it simmer till it cooks and turns a little soft. This could take anywhere between 2-3 hours as the dal gets it flavours from the slow cooking process. However, if you are in a hurry you can use the pressure cooker to hasten the process.Next, add the tomato and ginger to the dal. Once the dal is cooked, mash the dal and tomatoes a little bit. Take care not to make it mushy, but just achieve a thick consistency. Cook the dal for more 3 to 4 minutes.In a small pan, warm some ghee, add the cumin seeds and sauté till they turn slightly brown. Add dry red chillies, coriander powder, garam masala powder and roast on a low heat for 1 minute taking care not to burn them.Pour this tempering over the the dal and bring it to a boil.

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Baklava Recipe (Turkish Traditional Sweet), we first have to make sure we have all the ingredients ready.Baklava Recipe procedure is split into 4 parts.Method to prepare the fillingCoarsely chop the walnuts and pistachios in a food processor (it will be a coarse powder). Set aside 4 tablespoons of chopped nuts for decoration.Put the remainder in a bowl and combine it with 1/3 cup of sugar, cinnamon and cloves and mix well.Method to assemble and bake the baklavaHeat the oven to 170 C. Lay a dish towel on a work surface and sprinkle it lightly with water. Thaw the phyllo dough package according the manufacturer’s instructions.Unroll the sheets on the towel and then cover it with a second damp dish towel. When unrolling them I encountered several cracks and cuts in the sheets.Do not panic. They are easily repairable and do not make any difference in the dessert.Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Brush a baking pan with melted butter. Take a sheet of phyllo dough and carefully spread it in the pan, folding the sheet in such a way that it fits the pan.Brush the layered sheet with butter and gently press it into the sides and corners of the pan.Lay another sheet on top and brush with butter. Do the same with the third of the sheets. Once 1/3rd of the sheets have been used, scatter half the nut filling over the layers.Layer another third of the sheets in the pan, buttering each one and pressing into the corners and sides. Then sprinkle the remaining half of the nut mixture evenly.Layer the last third of the sheets, buttering them and pressing them the same way as we did with the previous layers. Brush the top most layer thoroughly with butter and pour any remainder of butter on the top (I ignored the last step. I did not pour the remaining butter. I just liberally brushed the top layer and left it at that).So essentially, after every 3 sheets there is a nut layer for the baklava recipe.With a small knife, cut diagonal lines around 1/2-inch deep to mark out the shape. Do not press down too much when cutting.Place the tray in the oven and bake for around 1 hr 15 minutes (It took me exactly 1 hr) until golden brown in color.Method to make the honey syrupCombine the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat until dissolved, stirring occasionally. Pour in the honey and stir to combine.Boil without stirring until the syrup reaches a soft ball consistency (239F on a candy thermometer). This process takes about 30  minutes.To test the consistency without the thermometer, take the pan off the heat and dip a teaspoon in the syrup. Let it cool down for few seconds and then drop it in a small cup with water.Once dropped into the water, it should form a mushy ball.Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool down to lukewarm temperature. Now add the juice from a lemon and the orange flower water or the vanilla extract.Method to finish the baklava recipeRemove the pan from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot baklava.Pouring the syrup over the hot pastries enables better absorption.With the chef’s knife cut along the marked lines almost to the bottom of the pan. Let the pastries cool.Cut through the marked lines completely and carefully lift the pastries with a spatula and arrange them on a plate.Sprinkle the top with the reserved nuts and serve the Baklava for your parties and special occasions.\n",

   "Instructions": "To begin making the Strawberry & Chocolate Rolls Recipe With Vanilla Glaze, we have to first make the strawberry filling for the roll. For the strawberry filling:In a pan, add the chopped strawberries and cook over medium-heat. Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring constantly, or until the strawberries become soft and mushy, and have released their juices.Add in the sugar and cornstarch stir vigorously to avoid forming lumps.  Continue to cook - and stir - for another 1-2 minutes. Remove pan from heat when the mixture thickens up and transfer the filling into a small bowl. Set aside.*To make the dough:In a pan, add the milk and heat on low flame for 1 minute until it becomes lukewarm. Turn off the flame. Now add a pinch of sugar and yeast to the lukewarm milk and stir it for few seconds. Keep aside undisturbed for 10 minutes or until froth appears on top of the milk. While adding the yeast to the milk, ensure that your milk is lukewarm and not hot, because if it is hot then chances are that your yeast will die.In a separate bowl, add sugar, egg, salt, melted butter, and the milk-yeast mixture. Whisk until all ingredients are well combined.Start adding the flour, 1/3rd at a time, and gently mix it with a spatula. Mix well, until a thick, sticky dough forms and all the flour is incorporated.Dump the dough on a well-floured surface and knead just until the dough is no longer sticky and forms a ball.This will take about 10-15 minutes.Alternatively you can even knead the dough in a food processor .Place the dough into a greased bowl. Put little bit oil on top of the dough, cover the bowl with a wet muslin cloth or a towel and allow the dough to rise at a warm place for at least an hour or until doubled in size.*To make the rolls:Once the dough has risen, put it on a lightly floured surface and gently squish the dough ball with your hands to make a rectangular shape. Now using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough while maintaining the rectangular shape. Roll it to a size of about 14 X 6\" rectangle.Now spread the cooled strawberry filling on the rolled out dough leaving about 1/2 inch border. On top of the strawberry filling, spread the grated chocolate.Start making the roll by rolling from the long side. (You have to roll length wise). Now using a serrated knife, cut out about 8 rolls and place them in a greased baking pan.Cover the pan with a wet muslin cloth or a towel and place it at a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes or until the rolls have doubled up in size.Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven at 180°C for about 25 minutes or until they become golden brown.Once your rolls are baked, remove them from the baking pan while they are still warm. Otherwise they will stick to the bottom due to sticky strawberry and chocolate filling.*For the glaze:In a bowl, add icing sugar, milk, and vanilla essence.Mix well using a whisk or a spoon until you get a smooth and lump free glaze.Drizzle the glaze over warm rollsServe this Strawberry & Chocolate Rolls With Vanilla Glaze as a Tea Time Cake along with a cup of Golden Detox Tea or even Qahwa - Arabic Coffee if you fancy it.\n",

Dip 6 of the 10 bread slices into the water, immediately take them out and squeeze out as much of the water as possible.Place the soggy bread in a bowl. Over this, crumble the remaining slices of bread and mash it all up together to form a soggy dough.To the dough add the hung curd, finely chopped onions and green chillies. Mix well and sprinkle in the black and white sesame seeds, sugar, red chilli powder, salt and cornflour. Mix it all together very well till it forms a mixture that is wet, but not so soggy that it cannot be easily handled.Set the mixture aside for 10-15 minutes to rest. Then divide it into 12-14 equal parts and shape them into small patties. To shape the patties with ease, it may help to grease your palms with a little oil so that the batter doesn't stick.The patties shouldn’t be too thick, as that will make it take longer to cook and absorb too much oil. Ensure that they are thin enough to cook easily and also hold shape.Preheat a skillet on medium heat. Place the patties on the skillet, drizzle some oil on the top and cook them evenly until golden brown and crisp on both sides.Keep turning them around until they are golden on both sides. Once done, remove the patties and place them on kitchen paper to drain the excess oil.Serve the Sesame Bread Patties (Bread Cutlets) along with lime wedges, tomato ketchup or Salad and serve it for a weeknight dinner.\n",

Grind the soaked rice, coconut and salt in a blender adding water little at a time to make a smooth batter. It is important to add a little water at a time to grind the rice into a smooth batter. When you feel the batter between your fingers it should be smooth and not coarse.Once the Neer Dosa batter is ground, transfer it to a large bowl. Add enough water such that the dosa batter has a smooth flowing consistency. The consistency of the batter should be such that the batter has a very thin coating at the back of the spoon and not a thick coating.

The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Neer Dosa, we don’t spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked and has a rich white colour. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Neer dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.Make sure you place the Neer Dosa’s away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other.
